Tweet2Speech streams over tweets from a specified target profile.
For each new tweet, T2S get the oral speech from the text thanks to Ivona API (http://developer.ivona.com/en/speechcloud/actions.html)
Then, it uploads the speech to Soundcloud and finally answer to the original tweet with the newly created soundcloud media.
Basically, T2S is an annoying parrot.
